Silhouette Cameo
  - paint 24mm blocked area in the GUI at the bottom of the paper.
  - put the Identify() output in a GUI element (rather than stdout).
  - new sorting algorithm to limit backward movements
    to max 20mm, so that we can cut paper and cardboard 
    without a mat in many cases.
  - debug this: when the paper was moved with the devices cursor keys, 
    "cut" will just home the paper and not cut at all.
